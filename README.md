# How the Audio Works

This audio file is automated and will add 5 different patterns in 30 second intervals. 

# How the Functions Operate

## Dancing Triangle : 

## Flame : 
1. Create Flame.java file which store the main code for the Flame function
2. Create a lerpbuffer which are used to slow down the frequencey change
3. Passing the lerbuffer and i (the width) value the Flame.java render
4. Using the PApplet map function generate the range of the heights of the Flame
5. Display the Flame using line function


## Square : 
1. Create Numbers (50) of Square.java each function represent for each square
2. Using for loop to passing the data to all the Square function
3. Using for loop to render and update all the Square.
4. Render -> Draw the Square and Used pushMatrix and popMatrix to allow us translate and rotate the square that we want.
5. Square update which is used to update the x, y and duration of the Square

## Square Train: 
1. Create Numbers (20) of SquareTrain.java each function represent for each Square Train
2. Using for loop to passing the data to all the Square Train function
3. Using for loop to render and update all the Square Train.
4. Render -> Draw the Square Train Using pushMatrix and popMatrix allow us translate the SquareTrain to the position that we want.
5. Update -> update the x and y of the Square Train
