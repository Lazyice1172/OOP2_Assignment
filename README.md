# How the Audio Works

This audio file is automated and will add 5 different patterns in 30 second intervals. 

# How the Functions Operate

## Dancing Triangle : 

## Flame : 
1. The 'Flame.java' file is created, which will store the main code for the 'Flame' function.
2. A lerpbuffer is created which will be used to slow down the change in frequency.
3. Passing the lerbuffer and 'i' value (the width) results in the 'Flame.java' rendering.
4. Using the PApplet map function, we generate the range of heights of the 'Flame'.
5. The Flame is displayed using the line function.


## Square : 
1. Create Numbers (50) of Square.java each function represent for each square
2. Using for loop to passing the data to all the Square function
3. Using for loop to render and update all the Square.
4. Render -> Draw the Square and Used pushMatrix and popMatrix to allow us translate and rotate the square that we want.
5. Square update which is used to update the x, y and duration of the Square

## Square Train: 
1. Create Numbers (20) of SquareTrain.java each function represent for each Square Train
2. Using for loop to passing the data to all the Square Train function
3. Using for loop to render and update all the Square Train.
4. Render -> Draw the Square Train Using pushMatrix and popMatrix allow us translate the SquareTrain to the position that we want.
5. Update -> update the x and y of the Square Train
